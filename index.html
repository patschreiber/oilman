    <p>You are an oil man who has just paid a hefty price for a deed to an oil field. You better start workin', because that deed wasn't cheap!</p>
    <p><b>To make matters worse</b>, the benefactor for your land wants to be paid back in gallons of oil; no U.S. dollars here!</p>
    <p>Begin by building up your oil infrastructure so you can start making moolah, then start shipping out the fruits of your labor to your benefactor.
    <br />
    <b>Be Warned!</b> Sometimes disaster can strike, impacting your finances or your oil production!

      To my good sir,
      <br />
      I am glad we were able to strike this deal for our mutual benefit. To you, I gave my acres of oil fields, ripe for the pickin' in exchange for quite a large, but fair, sum of money. 
      Now, as a gentleman of leisure, I don't expect that large sum of money to be paid back at all, but I do expect you to reciprocate the fine generosity I have shown you. All I ask for in return is a fair share of your oil field yield, once you get your operation up and running. 
      I really hope that this deal will be mutually beneficial to both of us. I sure do hate being on the wrong end of a raw deal. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Well partner, I guess this is goodbye until I see the return on my investment. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Best,
      <br />
      Chester
